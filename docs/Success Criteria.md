# **Success Criteria for Potatolk Project**
### The PAL project will be considered a success if...

**A fully functional system is delivered on April 19th.**  
The Potatolk project must be up and running by April 19, the date of the app's release. The application will be complete in all its features, the chat management, both private and group, will be efficient. The application will be fast and secure.

**Removing of all bugs.**  
Before the release date of the application you will have to perform appropriate tests to detect any bugs and fix them before the release, in order to optimize the application.

**App improvement.**  
Once every 6 months the app is subject to a review, to fix any bugs encountered during use and to improve it.

**Optimal data security.**  
Optimal data security will be guaranteed and will follow the GDPR guidelines. The user will therefore be aware of the use that will be made of his data and where it is stored. Security must be a priority.

**The System is properly documented.**  
First, a user manual shall be produced and included with the system. This user manual shall be easy to understand for non-technical users familiar with basic Internet and spreadsheet concepts. This manual shall explain only how to use all features of the system.

Second, a system manual shall be produced. This system manual shall consist of the architecture document, as well as any additional material required to provide a technician with all necessary information needed to maintain and update the system. A single read through of this document and no more than 2 hours looking at the code should provide an appropriately skilled technician with all the information necessary to understand the system and make simple changes.
