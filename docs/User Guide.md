## 1 Introduction

The Potatolk application allows users, through the use of a simple and intuitive interface, to exchange messages. This document will provide instructions for using the application, from the login operations, to the exchange of messages, to the logout operation.

#

## 2 Quick Start Guide

1. Tap the Potatolk&#39;s icon in your device menu. The login screen will be brought up.

2. You Need to obligatory enter a Username, the topic is optional, essentially it allow you to create some private chat, but later on we going to analyze the login with that too.

3. Tap the Sign in button If the name you have chosen satisfies you otherwise you can always change it

4. Or if you simply made a mistake in opening the chat you can simply press the cancel button or the x in the top right hand corner

The window of the chat will be displayed if the login was successful, so there must not have been any kind of error (read the section about the **errors** for more information), now you can chat quietly.

Within the chat window you can see various elements.

First of all, at the top you can see the name you entered and the topic you are currently in (not entering it will be &quot;general&quot;).

At the bottom left you can see the profile button, where you can go to change your information (username, topic, chat color, etc.).

Next to this button you can find another one that by clicking it you will see a list of all the people online.

By clicking on one of the names you will enter into private chat, of course you will be able to communicate only with that user.

At the bottom you can type the message that can be sent through the green button on the left and deleted through the red one always on the left.

5. Once you have finished using the chat you can log out by pressing the x in the top right corner.

6. The logout window will open

7. It will ask if you are sure you want to exit and just click the button with the word yes (otherwise click no to cancel).
#
## 3 Use Topic

As already said the topics are used to create some kind of private chat rooms even if they are not really this one.

Essentially, when you enter a specific topic (e.g. mathematics), you can only talk to people who have entered the same topic (so if Mario has entered the topic &quot;Italian&quot; and Luigi the topic &quot;mathematics&quot;, they will not be able to communicate).

## 4 Errors

In the chat in question the errors can be various:

- A username too short (less than 6 characters) or too long (more than 32 characters)
- An existing username
- too long a topic
- login without any username
- No connection to the server that will cause a login failure
- Absence of connection to the server that will cause a logout failure
- Strange characters that can cause an error when sending messages.
